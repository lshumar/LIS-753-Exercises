      <li><a href="../index.html">Link to homepage</a></li>
      <!-- This is a relative link, showing the destination relative to the current
          file.  The ../ indicates going up one level in the directory, so getting
          out of the Exercise folder and into the main LIS-753 directory.
          You want the links to behave the same way whether you're reading through
          the file on your device or looking at it via the web.-->
      <li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com">External link to Amazon</a></li>
      <!-- This is an absolute URL.  This is an external link, with the full URL. -->
    <!-- href stands for Hypertext REFerence. -->
    <!-- href is an attribute, which is additional information about the tag.
        For example, <a> is an anchor tag, and the attribute is where the tag goes.
        Attribute tags always have the attribute name, an = sign, and the attribute
        value in quotes.  You don't, technically, need quotes if there are no
        spaces in the attribute value, but consistent style is helpful.-->
